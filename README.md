## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a ride-share summary DataFrame by city type and multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The data preparation utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib to create DataFrames and charts to explore the data. This created multiple DataFrames to use for future analysis. Insight are generated on the <a href="PyBer_Challenge.ipynb">PyBer analysis</a>. 

### Ride-Sharing Summary By City Type

After consolidating the Ride-Sharing data by City Type, the results showcase that urban cities have the most rides, drivers and total fares ($), whereas rural cities have the least rides, drivers, and total fares ($).

However, when comparing the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, rural cities are the most expensive and urban cities are less expensive.

### Total Fares Summary By City Type

The week-over-week total fares by city type DataFrame and line chart shows us that between January 1 2019 to April 29 2019 that urban cities have the most total fares, followed by suburban cities and lastly followed by rural cities.

## Summary

After analyzing the ride-sharing summary and total weekly fares for each city type, the three business recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types are: 

1. Rural cities have the most expensive average fare per ride which can discourage those in rural areas to use ride-sharing services. To encourage rural city citizen to use the ride-sharing service, I suggest offering various promotions. This can include first-time offers, referrals, and off-peak hour discounts. 

2. The week-over-week change for each city type can vary by over $1000. This is a huge opportunity for the company if they can ensure consistent riders and fares. Since a ride-sharing business requires both drivers and riders, this first suggestion will target the drivers component. In order to ensure more consistent week-over-week fares, drivers will need to be more readily available to provide these services. By creating benefits for drivers, this can encourage them to be more active, such as off-peak bonuses or other employee benefits like health and dental benefits. 

3. In regards to the other stakeholder, riders, in this marketplace, I suggest encouraging more consistent rides. To do so, you can create an incentive program where after every 10 rides, you get 1 ride at a dicount. This can encourage riders to use this more consistently as they will get their 11th ride at an even cheaper rate.
